# intro-2-js
Here we can put stuff like :
<ul>
<li> Instructions for downloading the course files </li>
<li> Links to the power point presentation </li>
<li> Links to the Leaflet API and other documentation that would be helpful in the future</li>
</ul>

We could also include an explanation of how to use the branches if we decide to post the code for each step in the process as a separate branch
